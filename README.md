Clarify: Software for Interpreting and Presenting Statistical Results

Clarify is a program that uses Monte Carlo simulation to convert the raw output of statistical procedures into results that are of direct interest to researchers, without changing statistical assumptions or requiring new statistical models. The program offers a convenient way to implement the techniques described in: Gary King, Michael Tomz, and Jason Wittenberg (2000). “<a href="https://gking.harvard.edu/files/abs/making-abs.shtml">Making the Most of Statistical Analyses: Improving Interpretation and Presentation</a>.” Clarify simulates quantities of interest for the most commonly used statistical models, including linear regression, binary logit, binary probit, ordered logit, ordered probit, multinomial logit, Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, weibull regression, seemingly unrelated regression equations, and the additive logistic normal model for compositional data.
